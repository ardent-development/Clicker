... All previous development was done without a to-do list altogether.

- [X] Implement input validation
- [X] Make use of the status line to display processing and counting info
- [X] If the user responds "No" to the dialogs, then make the program exit immediately
- [X] If the output cannot be stored in a list, store them to variables in a dedicated folder "clkrvars"
- [X] Other random stuff I forgot to write down here
- [X] Release 3.0
